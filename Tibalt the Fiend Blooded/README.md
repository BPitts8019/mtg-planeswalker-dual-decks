In the spirit of the Planeswalker Deck Project, we're not going to let this guy's wacky abilities stop us from crafting something functional and flavorful.

Back in the good old days of 2012,
[Tibalt, the Fiend-Blooded](https://c1.scryfall.com/file/scryfall-cards/large/front/f/a/fa56d53c-836c-483d-988d-a288d0ad91bb.jpg?1592714451) made his debut. It was a time of rampant speculation, with people wondering whether or not Tibalt's weird set of stats would still be powerful if he joined the board on Turn 2; at this point there had never been a 2-mana PW and usually any PW that cost 3 mana was automatically worth Constructed consideration. If 3-mana Planeswalkers were usually great, 2-mana iterations had to be insane. ...Turns out, Tibalt kinda sucked. Whoops! His abilities don't defend himself very well, the random discard on his + ability hurt, and his ultimate still wasn't even that excellent. He went from Preview Season darling to kicked out of the clubhouse in record time.

Designing a deck for Mr. Tibalt was an exercise in frustration as well. I was interested in making a Madness theme around him, but as you'll find, there was another Planeswalker who worked just a bit better with that theme, so that option was off the table. Tibalt is a devil, so Devils maybe? Unfortunately, that option was similarly kicked around to another Walker (this time the other Tibalt). Hmmmm. Now what?

I asked my playgroup for some suggestions, and one of them responded that Tibalt was garbage and that I'd be better off trying to win a game by flipping coins than using his card. And the light bulb clicked on! What if we tried to use Tibalt while also flipping coins?

Embrace the chaos:

## The Game Plan

Dig around the couch cushions for some loose change, get ready to flip those coins, and let Fate decide! There are plenty of Magic players out there who believe that the game is more or less just all luck anyway. Dear reader, if you happen to be one such player, than boy, do I have the ultimate experience for you!

We've got plenty of effects that are fueled by random discards, and some of them are quite potent if they land where we want. We've got a few Madness cards just in case they get the nod, with
Reckless Wurm, Violent Eruption, and Fiery Temper getting fantastic discounts if they're chosen by chaos. There's also Scourge Devil and Vithian Stinger. which can Unearth if they're pitched away "by accident."

Goblin Bangchuckers (sidenote: I'd never seen this card before I did my research, and holy cow, what an A+ name) and Mogg Assassin can provide a whole lot of mileage when they work. And if they don't, hey caveat emptor baby. Dreamshaper Shaman and Treasure Keeper can provide similar excellent bonuses...or maybe situations that blow up in our faces.

Lastly, we have several cards here that will basically deliver a consistent, stabilizing effect but maybe some chaos adds a few bells and whistles. Minotaur Explorer, Dwarven Strike Force, Chain Lightning, Chain of Plasma, and Molten Birth fall under this category as cards you should probably try to play most games if you can, because you'll be getting the effect you're looking for when you cast them.

## The Rares

#### Crystalline Giant

      The Giant here can build up some pretty fearsome abilities; with a little bit of luck and some thoughtful prayers to the deity of your choice, they may even be the abilities you're looking for! At 3 mana, it's hard for this deck to do much better and there will be games where the crystal fella becomes unstoppable.

#### Krark's Thumb

      Well, we're looking to flip coins. Krark's Thumb gives us some extra tries. (Yay extra tries!) Why make it a 50% chance when we can make itâ€¦(checks the math)...uh...better than that?

## Unsung Hero

#### Throes of Chaos

      Cascade is a pretty random mechanic. Most of the time a Cascade spell is cast, the math is "what you're getting for this spell's effect + a random card." Throes cuts down the fat and lets us mainline that randomness. What this also does is turn our late game useless lands into additional lottery tickets. And as everyone who plays the lottery knows, the more tickets you buy the more likely you are to hit, so Retrace early and often.
