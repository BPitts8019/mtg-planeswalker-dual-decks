# Planeswalker Dual Decks

This is a collection of planeswalker decks created by Andy Hurst and published in a series of articles for [TCGPlayer](https://infinite.tcgplayer.com/magic-the-gathering/series/planeswalker-duel-decks)

the initial plan is to simply collect the decks I find intersting from the series and archive them here. However, I may add my own Planeswalker Dual Decks in the future.
